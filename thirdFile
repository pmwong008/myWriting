This time I am repeating all the steps in the previous files, except that I want to see what is the meaning of Soft wrap.
  The indent mode is "Space" and the indent size is 2.
  I changed the wrap option to Soft wrap, but there is no difference I can identify. 

Editing this file after it has been committed earlier.
